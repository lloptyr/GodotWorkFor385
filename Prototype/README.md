Pitch:  
Play as Harper Chase stuck in a mysterious maze with deadly enemies. Harness mysterious runes to
augment your abilities. Discover secrets, and unravel the mysteries of the maze. Can you escape? Or
will you be forgotten amongst the vines?  

Synopsis:  
Harper Chase wakes up in a forested maze with a sword and no memories of how they arrived there. 
With nothing else to go on, they progress into the maze, filled with increasingly deadly enemies, and 
strange runes, desperate to find a way out. As you play as Harper, you will discover runes that change 
the way you can move through the levels, allowing you to climb walls and dash over large gaps. These 
new abilities allow you to access places that you couldnâ€™t, when you first passed them by. Secret areas 
hide consumables, new runes, and lore of the maze. Can you find the exit? Be wary of who might wait 
for you there.

So, this is using my GODOT tutorial from before, and implementing more items as we go. At this point it is a very different game than the hello-world version.  
I have made a level that actually has the new tileset, and feel like it's more indicative of the game as I would build it.  
Godot upgraded to a new version that caused some pretty serious issues, but those have been resolved.  
There are still plenty of items on the to-do list, but I needed to focus on getting a functional level that was indicative of what the rest of the game would be.  
Honestly I wanted to do more with this with the time I had in this class, but other classes consumed my last couple of weeks, and I still barely passed them.  
This project has been a lot of fun and I would enjoy continuing to work on it and maybe develop a full game out of it at some point.  
Hopefully this is enough for the 80% completion. I do have a full stage, but as you can see, from here there's a lot of work to turn it into a funished product.  
This was entirely my own work. Being a solo dev made the decision process easier, though I struggled more with the technical aspects. Not being able to delegate tasks and research meant that much of my time was spent sifting through documentation and trying to implement things on my own.  


ToDo (priority order): 
1. change collision-less wall/s to destructible wall/s   
1. Add dash power-up  
1. Update health system to be more visually appealing  
1. new enemies  
1. boss/es  
1. in-world lore  
1. more abilities  
1. ability upgrades  
1. minor Bug fixing  
1. fix animation cancelling
1. balancing  

Potential ToDo (definitely outside the scope of this class):
1. Merge with GF's game idea(?)  
1. Sprite overhaul 2.0
