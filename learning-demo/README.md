Hello, and welcome to my godot tutorial demo attempt. 

I followed the tutorial linked at the bottom, choosing to design the levels in my own way.

I found the tutorial helpful, but it was for Godot 3, and I am using Godot 4.

This resulted in many functions and methods being deprecated, and a lot of research went into fixing them.

I do have a movement bug, but I am unsure if it is on my end, or a bug in my code.

To replicate:

	Load the game

	Move back and forth while jumping

	Occasionally, lateral movement will completely stop

You can see this happen several times in the video, where the movement jitters, or I fall straight down after a jump.

I am unsure what causes this, it may be the tutorial's fault, the tutorial being out of date, or my machine.

Otherwise I found Godot well documented, and somewhat easy to work with.
